Elbow Method:
   
            This a graphical method to choose optimum number of 
   clusters. We need calculate Within Cluster Sum of Squared(WCSS) using 
   for range of clusters by using loop and then add all WCSS to list
   the plot it against Number of CLusters. The WCSS will drop
   drastically initially and then WCSS drop becomes less significant.
   The point where the WCSS drop starts becoming insignificant 
   is the optimum number of Clusters
