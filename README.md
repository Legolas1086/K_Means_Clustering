# K_Means_Clustering
K means clustering model on a simple data:
          
          This algorithm create k clusters where k should be specified 
    as a parameter while creating object of this algorithm class.
    The algorithm creates k centroid by k-means++ to elimminate 
    random centroid initialization trap. The data point is assigned to 
    the cluster of nearest centroid, and optimization takes place.
